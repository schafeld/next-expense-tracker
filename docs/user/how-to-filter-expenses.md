# How to Filter Your Expenses

## What are Expense Filters?

The expense filtering feature helps you quickly find specific expenses by narrowing down your expense list based on different criteria. Instead of scrolling through hundreds of expenses, you can instantly focus on exactly what you're looking for.

### Benefits and Use Cases

- **Find Specific Transactions**: Quickly locate that restaurant charge from last month
- **Analyze Spending Patterns**: View only food expenses to track dining habits
- **Prepare Reports**: Filter by date range for monthly or quarterly summaries
- **Budget Review**: Focus on specific categories to see where your money goes
- **Tax Preparation**: Filter by business-related categories and date ranges

### When to Use Filters

- **Monthly Reviews**: Filter by date to see this month's spending
- **Category Analysis**: Filter by "Food" to see all restaurant and grocery expenses
- **Finding Duplicates**: Search for specific amounts or descriptions
- **Budget Planning**: Review spending in specific categories before setting budgets
- **Expense Reports**: Filter by date range and category for work reimbursements

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Filters

The expense filters are located just above your expense list on the main dashboard. You'll see a white card labeled "Filters" with four different filter options arranged in a grid.

### Prerequisites

- You need to have at least one expense entry to see filtering results
- No special setup required - filters work immediately with your existing data

## Using the Filters

### 1. Search by Keywords

The search filter helps you find expenses by typing keywords that match the expense description or category.

**How to use:**
1. Click in the "Search" text box
2. Type any word or phrase you remember about the expense
3. Results update instantly as you type
4. Clear the search box to remove the filter

**What it searches:**
- **Expense descriptions**: "coffee", "gas", "groceries"
- **Categories**: "Food", "Transportation", "Bills"

**Examples:**
- Type "coffee" → Shows all expenses with "coffee" in the description
- Type "uber" → Shows all Uber rides or similar transportation expenses
- Type "food" → Shows both expenses categorized as "Food" AND any expense with "food" in the description

**Pro Tips:**
- Search is case-insensitive (works with "COFFEE", "Coffee", or "coffee")
- Use partial words - "rest" will find "restaurant" expenses
- Try different keywords if you don't find what you're looking for

### 2. Filter by Category

The category filter shows only expenses from a specific spending category.

**How to use:**
1. Click the "Category" dropdown menu
2. Select any category from the list
3. Choose "All" to remove the category filter

**Available Categories:**
- **All** - Shows expenses from every category (no filtering)
- **Food** - Restaurant meals, groceries, coffee shops, food delivery
- **Transportation** - Gas, public transit, ride-sharing, parking
- **Entertainment** - Movies, concerts, games, streaming services
- **Shopping** - Clothing, electronics, household items, online purchases
- **Bills** - Utilities, insurance, subscriptions, rent/mortgage
- **Other** - Any expenses that don't fit the above categories

**Examples:**
- Select "Food" → See only restaurant and grocery expenses
- Select "Transportation" → View all travel and commute costs
- Select "Bills" → Focus on recurring monthly expenses

### 3. Filter by Date Range

Date filtering lets you view expenses from a specific time period by setting start and end dates.

**How to use:**
1. **From Date**: Click the "From Date" field and select a start date
2. **To Date**: Click the "To Date" field and select an end date
3. Use one or both date fields as needed
4. Clear either field to remove that part of the date filter

**Date Filter Options:**
- **From Date Only**: Shows all expenses from that date forward
- **To Date Only**: Shows all expenses up to that date
- **Both Dates**: Shows expenses only within that specific range

**Common Date Filters:**
- **This Month**: Set "From Date" to the 1st of current month, leave "To Date" empty
- **Last Month**: Set both dates to cover the previous month's range
- **Quarterly Review**: Set a 3-month range for seasonal analysis
- **Annual Summary**: Set January 1st to December 31st for yearly totals

**Examples:**
- From: 2024-01-01, To: 2024-01-31 → Shows all January 2024 expenses
- From: 2024-06-01, To: (empty) → Shows all expenses from June 1st onwards
- From: (empty), To: 2024-12-31 → Shows all expenses up to December 31st

### 4. Combining Multiple Filters

You can use multiple filters simultaneously to create very specific views of your expenses.

**How it works:**
- All active filters work together (AND logic)
- An expense must match ALL applied filters to appear in the results
- Combine any or all of the four filter types

**Powerful Filter Combinations:**

**Example 1: Monthly Food Spending**
- Category: "Food"
- From Date: First day of the month
- To Date: Last day of the month
- *Result: Shows only food expenses from a specific month*

**Example 2: Finding a Specific Restaurant Bill**
- Search: "italiano" (restaurant name)
- Category: "Food"
- From Date: Approximate date you visited
- *Result: Narrows down to that specific dining experience*

**Example 3: Business Travel Expenses**
- Search: "hotel" or "flight"
- Category: "Transportation"
- Date range: Your business trip dates
- *Result: Perfect for expense reports and reimbursements*

## Tips and Best Practices

### Search Strategy Tips

1. **Start Broad, Then Narrow**: Begin with category filtering, then add search terms
2. **Try Variations**: If "restaurant" doesn't work, try "food" or the restaurant name
3. **Use Memorable Details**: Search for location, merchant name, or unique descriptors
4. **Check Your Spelling**: Typos in search won't match your expense descriptions

### Date Filtering Best Practices

1. **Monthly Reviews**: Use the first and last day of each month for clean monthly views
2. **Quarter Analysis**: Use 3-month ranges (Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, etc.) for quarterly reports
3. **Tax Season**: Filter by tax year dates to gather deductible expenses
4. **Budget Cycles**: Align date ranges with your personal budgeting periods

### Category Organization Tips

1. **Consistent Categorization**: Review and recategorize old expenses for better filtering
2. **Use "Other" Sparingly**: Most expenses fit into the main categories for better organization
3. **Regular Category Review**: Periodically check if your categorization still makes sense

### Filter Efficiency Tips

1. **Clear Filters Regularly**: Start with a clean slate for new searches
2. **Save Mental Notes**: Remember successful filter combinations for future use
3. **Export Filtered Data**: Use the export button to save filtered results to spreadsheet
4. **Mobile-Friendly**: All filters work the same way on phones and tablets

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Problem**: "I can't find an expense I know exists"
- **Solution**: Clear all filters first, then try different search terms or categories
- **Check**: Verify the expense date falls within your date range
- **Tip**: Try searching for partial words or different spellings

**Problem**: "The date filter isn't working"
- **Solution**: Make sure your date format matches the expected format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Check**: Ensure the "From Date" is earlier than the "To Date"
- **Tip**: Clear both date fields and try setting them again

**Problem**: "No results show up when combining filters"
- **Solution**: Your filters might be too restrictive - try removing one filter at a time
- **Check**: Verify that expenses exist that match all your criteria
- **Tip**: Start with one filter and add others gradually

**Problem**: "Search results seem incomplete"
- **Solution**: Try different keywords - search looks for exact text matches
- **Check**: Look in the expense description to see exactly how it's written
- **Tip**: Search is case-insensitive, but spelling must be exact

### Error Messages and Their Meanings

Most filtering happens instantly without error messages, but if you experience issues:

- **No Results Found**: Your filter criteria don't match any expenses
- **Date Range Invalid**: Your end date is earlier than your start date
- **Filter Reset**: Filters have been cleared due to an unexpected issue
