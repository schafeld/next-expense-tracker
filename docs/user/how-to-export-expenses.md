## Understanding Your Exported Data

### CSV File Structure

Your exported file contains the following columns:

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Date** | When the expense occurred | "Jan 15, 2024" |
| **Description** | What you spent money on | "Grocery shopping" |
| **Category** | Type of expense | "Food" |
| **Amount** | How much you spent | "45.67" |

### Data Format Details

- **Dates** are formatted as "Month Day, Year" (e.g., "Jan 15, 2024")
- **Amounts** are in decimal format without currency symbols
- **Categories** match exactly what you see in the app
- **Descriptions** are exactly as you entered them

## Tips and Best Practices

### Pro Tips for Effective Usage

1. **Export Regularly** - Create monthly backups of your data
2. **Use Filters First** - Apply date ranges or category filters before exporting for specific reports
3. **Consistent Naming** - Keep your expense descriptions consistent for better data analysis
4. **Check Before Exporting** - Review your expense list to ensure accuracy

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Don't forget to apply filters** if you only want specific expenses
- **Don't export with no expenses** - the button will be disabled but check your data first
- **Don't rely solely on exports** - the app maintains your primary data
- **Don't share sensitive files** without considering privacy

### Optimization Suggestions

- **Organize by categories** before exporting for cleaner reports
- **Add detailed descriptions** to make exported data more useful
- **Use consistent date formats** when manually entering expenses
- **Review and clean up data** before important exports

4. Create charts and summaries as needed

### Tax Preparation Workflow

1. Filter expenses by tax-relevant categories (like "Bills" for deductible expenses)
2. Set date range for the tax year
3. Export the filtered data
4. Share with your accountant or import into tax software

### Sharing with Family

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Problem: Export button is grayed out
**Cause**: You have no expenses to export
**Solution**: Add some expenses first, or check if your filters are too restrictive

**Cause**: Browser popup blocker or download restrictions
**Solution**: 
- Check your browser's download settings

**Cause**: Character encoding issues
**Solution**:
- Open the file in a text editor first
