I want you to create a modern, professional NextJS expense tracking application. Here's my vision:

Please create this as a complete, production-ready application. Set up the project structure, implement all features, and make sure everything works together seamlessly. Focus on creating something that looks professional and that I could actually use to track my expenses.

When you're done, provide instructions on how to run the application and test all features.
