[Original prompt for code analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/claude-code/supplement/Pagju/exercise-ai-evaluation-of-code-feature-implementations)


I have three different implementations of data export functionality across three git branches in my expense tracker application. I want to create a systematic evaluation framework to compare them thoroughly.

BACKGROUND:
- feature-data-export-v1: Simple CSV export (one-button approach)
- feature-data-export-v2: Advanced export with multiple formats and filtering options
- feature-data-export-v3: Cloud integration with sharing and collaboration features

Now I want you to systematically analyze each of three features implementations by switching between branches and examining the code, architecture, and implementation details.

ANALYSIS PROCESS:
For each branch (v1, v2, v3), please:

1. Switch to the branch
2. Examine all the files that were created or modified
3. Analyze the code architecture and patterns used
4. Look at component structure and organization
5. Review the user interface implementation
6. Check for error handling and edge cases
7. Assess the technical approach and libraries used

DOCUMENTATION:
Create a file called "code-analysis.md" with detailed findings for each version:

**For Each Version, Document:**
- Files created/modified (list them)
- Code architecture overview (how is it organized?)
- Key components and their responsibilities
- Libraries and dependencies used
- Implementation patterns and approaches
- Code complexity assessment
- Error handling approach
- Security considerations
- Performance implications
- Extensibility and maintainability factors

**Technical Deep Dive:**
- How does the export functionality work technically?
- What file generation approach is used?
- How is user interaction handled?
- What state management patterns are used?
- How are edge cases handled?

Be thorough and technical - this analysis will inform our decision about which approach to adopt or how to combine them.
